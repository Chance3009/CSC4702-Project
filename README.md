## 🎓 Educational Methodology

### Audience Adaptation Strategy

| Level | Language | Math | Challenge |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Junior** | Conversational | None | Accuracy without formalism |
| **High School** | Technical but accessible | Trigonometry | Bridging intuition & algebra |
| **Undergraduate** | Formal notation | Linear algebra | Comprehensive yet accessible |

### Progressive Disclosure Principle

We introduce complexity gradually:
1. Start with intuitive, visual understanding
2. Layer on mathematical formalism
3. Build to professional-level concepts
4. Maintain narrative continuity throughout
