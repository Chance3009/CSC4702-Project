## 📋 Project Overview

This comprehensive educational project introduces the fundamental concepts of **position and orientation** in robotics across three progressive educational levels:

- 🎯 **Junior School**: Intuitive, visual explanations
- 📐 **High School**: Mathematical foundations with trigonometry
- 🎓 **Undergraduate**: Advanced transformation matrices

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By engaging with this project, learners will:

1. **Understand** how robots perceive position and orientation
2. **Connect** intuitive concepts to mathematical representations
3. **Explore** 2D rotation matrices and 3D transformations
4. **Experiment** with homogeneous transformation matrices
5. **Apply** spatial reasoning to real-world robotics scenarios

## 🎬 Video Series

### Video 1: Junior School
**Focus**: Compass directions and intuitive navigation  
**Key Concepts**: How robots know which way they're facing

### Video 2: High School
**Focus**: Angles, trigonometry, and 2×2 rotation matrices  
**Key Concepts**: Converting directions into mathematical formulas

### Video 3: Undergraduate
**Focus**: 4×4 homogeneous transformation matrices  
**Key Concepts**: Professional robotics mathematics and frame composition

## 🎮 Interactive Visualizer

An interactive 3D tool where you can manipulate a robot's position and orientation in real-time. Adjust translation (X, Y, Z) and rotation (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) parameters to see how they affect the transformation matrix.

**Launch it from**: `interactive.html` → "Launch Interactive Visualizer"

## 🎓 Educational Methodology

### Audience Adaptation Strategy

| Level | Language | Math | Challenge |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Junior** | Conversational | None | Accuracy without formalism |
| **High School** | Technical but accessible | Trigonometry | Bridging intuition & algebra |
| **Undergraduate** | Formal notation | Linear algebra | Comprehensive yet accessible |

### Progressive Disclosure Principle

We introduce complexity gradually:
1. Start with intuitive, visual understanding
2. Layer on mathematical formalism
3. Build to professional-level concepts
4. Maintain narrative continuity throughout
